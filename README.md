## Evolutive Programming
A small-scale experiment using Evolutionary Programming (EP) to approximate the square root of a given number $x$. 
Unlike Genetic Algorithms that focus on recombination (crossover), this experiment relies on mutation and selection to evolve a population of candidate solutions.
